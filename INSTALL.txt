- Download Anaconda3 https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Download Git https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Download NI Package Manager (latest offline version): https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.package-manager.html#322516
- Open NI Package Manager, and through there install these packages (wait for restart until you're done with all three installs):
    - Latest NI VISA package
    - Latest NI DAQmx package
    - NI 488.2 v17.0 (any later versions will NOT run knockoff GPIB-USB adapters, and no additional functionality is gained by installing a newer version)

- Open Anaconda Prompt to install QCoDeS, and choose from one of the following installation options:
    1) (RECOMMENDED) To install a non-editable version in the base anaconda environment:
      - conda config --add channels conda-forge
      - conda update conda
      - conda install qcodes pip
    2) To install run the following to install a non-editable version in a separate environment:
      - conda config --add channels conda-forge
      - conda update -n base conda
      - conda create --name qcodes python=3.10
      - conda activate qcodes
      - conda install -c conda-forge qcodes pip
    3) Run the following to install an editable version of QCoDeS in a new environment:
      - Download QCoDeS repository 'git clone https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes.git' (will download QCoDeS repository at current location)
      - From Anaconda Prompt, move into QCoDeS repository, and run:
      - conda config --add channels conda-forge
      - conda update -n base conda
      - conda env create -f environment.yml
      - conda activate qcodes
      - conda install qcodes
After installing QCoDeS, install the rest of the packages
- conda config --add channels conda-forge 
- conda install nidaqmx-python jupyterlab conda-build pyqt
- Download this repository 'git clone https://github.com/nanophys/MeasureIt.git'
- Set 'MeasureItHome' to base folder in the MeasureIt repository as an environment variable in your Windows system.
- From Anaconda Prompt, move into MeasureIt repository, and run:
    - conda activate qcodes
    - python setup.py

To install the contributor drivers (such as the Oxford IPS120), in Anaconda Prompt either:
1) (RECOMMENDED) Install an uneditable version
  - conda install pip
  - pip install qcodes_contrib_drivers
2) Download an editable local version
  - Download repository, 'git clone https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes_contrib_drivers.git'
  - Move into the repository directory, and run 'conda develop .'
You can now directly access the module by calling 'import qcodes_contrib_drivers' in python scripts

To create a desktop icon:
- Add the following to PATH (under system's environment variables):
    - "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3"
    - "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\Scripts"
    - "%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\condabin"
- Right-click 'MeasureIt.bat' in the repository, and change the second line to match the user's path to the repository
- Right-click 'MeasureIt.bat' and click 'Create shortcut' and drag the new shortcut to the desktop

TO UPDATE:
- To update MeasureIt, open the terminal, move into the MeasureIt base directory and run:
    - git pull
- To update QCodes_contrib_drivers, open the terminal, move into the Qcodes_contrib_drivers base directory and run:
    - git pull
- To update a non-editable installation of QCoDeS from Anaconda Prompt:
    - conda update -n base -c defaults conda  (not strictly required but is best practice)
    - conda activate qcodes
    - conda update qcodes
- To update an editable installation of QCoDeS: from Anaconda Prompt, move into QCoDeS repository, and run:v
    - conda update -n base -c defaults conda  (not strictly required but is best practice)
    - git pull
    - conda activate qcodes
    - conda env update --file environment.yml
    - conda develop .
